1. 
For the Algorithm A, 
the best case is  O(n)
the average case is O(n)
the worst case is O(n)
because it searches the array sequentially, it needs n operations

2.
For the algorithm B,
the best case is O(n log n)
the avg case is O(n log n)
the worst case is O(n log n)
because the algorithm B is a merge sort, and merg sor t is a divide and conquer algorithm 

3. 
algorithm B will be faster, because merge sort has faster sorting speed with a worst case complexity O(nlogn)
